# Cat-or-Not
In this experiment, you will implement a 2 Layer Neural Network to solve a real world machine
learning problem with a real world data. In this experiment, you will get familiar Python
data science libraries such as; Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. At the end, you will build a
deep neural network that classifies cat vs. non-cat images.
